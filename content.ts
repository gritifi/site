        about2: 'I launched Gritifi as a studio where cultural soul meets strategic creativity. My background in graphic design and my roots in a small Bulgarian town shape everything I create — from bold brand identities to thoughtful visual systems. Whether I’m working with a local artisan or an international startup, I bring empathy, clarity, and intention to every project.'
